> *Crypto tidak ada di vacuum - semuanya terhubung dengan global economy dan forex markets*

---

## 📋 Pendahuluan

**Global macro dan forex analysis adalah kunci untuk memahami crypto markets di era modern**. Cryptocurrency tidak lagi bergerak terisolasi - mereka menjadi bagian integral dari sistem keuangan global. Untuk investor Indonesia, memahami koneksi ini sangat penting karena:

1. **Global Markets Impact**: Crypto market cap $2.3+ triliun, terlalu besar untuk tidak terpengaruh global events
2. **USD Correlation**: Bitcoin dan altcoins punya korelasi kuat dengan USD movements
3. **Indonesian Context**: Rupiah performance mempengaruhi crypto adoption dan investment decisions
4. **Professional Trading**: Institutional investors menggunakan macro analysis untuk crypto positions
5. **Risk Management**: Global events create both opportunities dan risks untuk crypto portfolios

### 🎯 Kenapa Ini Penting untuk Investor Indonesia?
- **USD-IDR Volatility**: Rupiah sering volatile, mempengaruhi crypto valuation dalam IDR terms
- **Commodity Connection**: Indonesia sebagai negara komoditas terpengaruh global commodity cycles
- **Inflation Hedge**: Crypto menjadi hedge terhadap inflation yang sering tinggi di Indonesia
- **Capital Flows**: Global capital flows mempengaruhi liquidity di crypto market Indonesia
- **Professional Development**: Skill ini membedakan retail trader dari professional investor
