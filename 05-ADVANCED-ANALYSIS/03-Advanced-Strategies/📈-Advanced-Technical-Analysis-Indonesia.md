## üîß Advanced Risk Management

### **Portfolio Level Risk Management**

#### **Advanced Position Sizing**
```
Scientific Position Sizing Methods:

1. Kelly Criterion
Formula: f* = (bp - q) / b
Where:
- f* = Optimal fraction of capital
- b = Net odds (Win/Loss ratio)
- p = Probability of winning
- q = Probability of losing (1-p)

Application to Indonesian Stocks:
Example Trading System:
- Win rate: 65% (p = 0.65)
- Average win: Rp 5,000,000
- Average loss: Rp 3,000,000
- Net odds: b = 5/3 = 1.67

Kelly Calculation:
f* = (0.65 √ó 1.67 - 0.35) / 1.67
f* = (1.0855 - 0.35) / 1.67
f* = 0.7355 / 1.67
f* = 0.44 or 44% of capital

Practical Application:
- Full Kelly: 44% (too aggressive)
- Half Kelly: 22% (recommended)
- Quarter Kelly: 11% (conservative)
- Multiple positions: 5-8% each

2. Optimal f (Ralph Vince)
Formula: Based on historical drawdown
- Calculate maximum drawdown
- Determine optimal exposure
- Adjust for risk tolerance

3. Fixed Fractional
- Fixed percentage per trade (1-3%)
- Adjusted for volatility
- Simple and effective
- Widely used

4. Volatility Adjusted
- Position size inversely proportional to volatility
- High volatility = smaller position
- Low volatility = larger position
- Normalizes risk across positions
```

#### **Portfolio Optimization**
```
Modern Portfolio Theory Application:

1. Efficient Frontier Construction
Steps:
- Calculate expected returns
- Compute covariance matrix
- Generate portfolio combinations
- Identify optimal portfolios
- Select based on risk tolerance

Indonesian Market Implementation:
Asset Classes:
- Indonesian Equities (65% allocation)
- Government Bonds (20% allocation)
- Corporate Bonds (10% allocation)
- Gold/Cash (5% allocation)

Sector Allocation:
- Banking: 25%
- Consumer: 20%
- Infrastructure: 15%
- Resources: 15%
- Property: 10%
- Others: 15%

2. Risk Parity Approach
Equal Risk Contribution:
- Each asset class contributes equal risk
- Leverage adjustment for low-risk assets
- Deleveraging high-risk assets
- Target volatility: 12-15% annually

3. Maximum Diversification
Maximize diversification ratio:
- Weight assets by inverse volatility
- Minimize correlation impact
- Focus on uncorrelated returns
- Rebalance quarterly

Performance Metrics:
- Sharpe ratio: Target > 1.5
- Sortino ratio: Target > 2.0
- Maximum drawdown: < 20%
- Calmar ratio: Target > 2.0
```

### **Advanced Risk Metrics**

#### **Quantitative Risk Measures**
```
Advanced Risk Metrics:

1. Value at Risk (VaR)
Methods:
- Historical VaR: Based on historical returns
- Parametric VaR: Normal distribution assumption
- Monte Carlo VaR: Simulation based
- Conditional VaR: Expected shortfall

Indonesian Market Example:
Portfolio value: Rp 1,000,000,000
Time horizon: 1 day
Confidence level: 95%
Historical volatility: 1.8% daily

Calculation:
VaR (95%) = Portfolio √ó Volatility √ó Z-score
VaR (95%) = 1B √ó 1.8% √ó 1.65 = Rp 29,700,000

Interpretation:
- 95% confidence of losing < Rp 29.7M daily
- 5% chance of losing > Rp 29.7M daily
- Use for position sizing and limits

2. Expected Shortfall (ES)
- Average loss beyond VaR
- More conservative than VaR
- Better for tail risk assessment
- Used for stress testing

3. Beta Calculation
Market sensitivity measurement:
- Beta > 1: More volatile than market
- Beta < 1: Less volatile than market
- Beta < 0: Negative correlation
- Sector-specific betas important

4. Alpha Generation
Risk-adjusted outperformance:
- Jensen's alpha calculation
- Information ratio
- Tracking error
- Active share measurement
```
