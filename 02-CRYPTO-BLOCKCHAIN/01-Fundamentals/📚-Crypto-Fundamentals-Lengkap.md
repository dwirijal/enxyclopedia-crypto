- **Immutable**: Historical data cannot be changed
- **Secure**: Cryptographically secured
- **Consistent**: All nodes have same data
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all changes
```

#### **Cara Kerja Blockchain**
```
⚙️ Blockchain Mechanics:

1. **Block Creation**
   - Transactions grouped into blocks
   - Each block has unique hash
   - Blocks linked sequentially
   - Reference to previous block hash

2. **Consensus Mechanisms**
   - Proof of Work (Bitcoin)
   - Proof of Stake (Ethereum 2.0)
   - Delegated Proof of Stake
   - Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
   - Proof of Authority

3. **Network Architecture**
   - Peer-to-peer network
   - Nodes validate transactions
   - Miners/validators create blocks
   - Full nodes store entire blockchain

4. **Cryptographic Security**
