# Bitcoin Fundamentals

## ü™ô What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized digital currency, created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a peer-to-peer network without a central authority or banks.

### Key Characteristics
- **Decentralized**: No single entity controls Bitcoin
- **Limited Supply**: Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist
- **Transparent**: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger
- **Immutable**: Transactions cannot be reversed once confirmed
- **Borderless**: Can be sent anywhere in the world

## üí∞ Bitcoin Economics

### Supply Mechanics
- **Total Supply**: 21 million BTC (hard cap)
- **Current Supply**: ~19.5 million BTC (as of 2025)
- **Block Reward**: Started at 50 BTC, halves every 210,000 blocks
- **Halving Schedule**:
  - 2009: 50 BTC
  - 2012: 25 BTC
  - 2016: 12.5 BTC
  - 2020: 6.25 BTC
  - 2024: 3.125 BTC
  - 2028: 1.5625 BTC
  - ...until approximately 2140

### Inflation Rate
- **Current**: ~0.8% annually (after 2024 halving)
- **Decreasing**: Approaches zero over time
- **Comparison**: Much lower than traditional fiat currencies

### Market Metrics
- **Market Cap**: Varies (typically $500B - $1T+)
- **Price**: Highly volatile, influenced by supply/demand
- **Dominance**: Bitcoin's share of total crypto market (~40-50%)

## ‚õèÔ∏è Mining and Consensus

### Proof of Work (PoW)
- **Purpose**: Secures the network and validates transactions
- **Process**: Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems
- **Reward**: New bitcoins + transaction fees
- **Difficulty**: Adjusts every 2016 blocks to maintain 10-minute block time

### Mining Process
1. **Transaction Pool**: Unconfirmed transactions wait in mempool
2. **Block Creation**: Miners group transactions into blocks
3. **Hashing**: Miners attempt to find valid hash below target
4. **Validation**: Network verifies the solution
5. **Confirmation**: Block added to blockchain, miner rewarded

### Mining Evolution
- **CPU Mining**: Early days (2009-2010)
- **GPU Mining**: Graphics cards (2010-2013)
- **ASIC Mining**: Specialized hardware (2013-present)
- **Mining Pools**: Groups of miners combining resources
- **Industrial Mining**: Large-scale operations

## üèóÔ∏è Bitcoin Network

### Network Structure
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Direct communication between nodes
- **Nodes**: Computers running Bitcoin software
- **Full Nodes**: Store complete blockchain and validate transactions
- **Light Nodes**: Store only block headers (SPV wallets)

### Transaction Flow
1. **Initiation**: User creates transaction
2. **Broadcasting**: Transaction sent to network
3. **Validation**: Nodes verify transaction validity
4. **Mempool**: Transaction waits to be included in block
5. **Mining**: Miner includes transaction in block
6. **Confirmation**: Block added to blockchain
7. **Finality**: Transaction becomes irreversible after confirmations

### Key Network Metrics
- **Block Time**: ~10 minutes average
- **Transactions per Block**: ~1,500-4,000
- **TPS**: ~3-7 transactions per second
- **Confirmations**: 6 confirmations = ~1 hour (considered final)

## üíº Bitcoin as Money

### Store of Value
- **Digital Gold**: Scarcity and durability make it valuable
- **Hedge Against Inflation**: Fixed supply protects against currency devaluation
- **Long-term Investment**: Many hold as savings technology

### Medium of Exchange
- **Payment Method**: Accepted by growing number of merchants
- **Cross-border**: Efficient for international transfers
- **Microtransactions**: Lightning Network enables small payments

### Unit of Account
- **Pricing**: Some goods/services priced directly in BTC
- **Accounting**: Growing use for business accounting
- **Measurement**: Used to value other cryptocurrencies

## üóùÔ∏è Bitcoin Security

### Cryptographic Foundations
- **Private Keys**: Secret numbers that control BTC
- **Public Keys**: Derived from private keys, used to generate addresses
- **Addresses**: Shareable identifiers for receiving BTC
- **Signatures**: Prove ownership of private keys

### Wallet Types
- **Hot Wallets**: Connected to internet (convenient, less secure)
- **Cold Wallets**: Offline storage (more secure, less convenient)
- **Hardware Wallets**: Physical devices (Ledger, Trezor)
- **Paper Wallets**: Private keys printed on paper
- **Brain Wallets**: Private keys memorized as phrases

### Security Best Practices
- **Private Key Control**: Never share private keys
- **Backup**: Multiple secure backups
- **Multi-signature**: Require multiple signatures for transactions
- **2FA**: Two-factor authentication for exchanges
- **Cold Storage**: Large amounts in cold wallets

## üìà Price History and Adoption

### Major Price Milestones
- **2010**: First BTC price established ($0.001)
- **2011**: Reached parity with USD ($1)
- **2013**: First major bull run ($266)
- **2017**: Reached $20,000
- **2021**: All-time high ~$69,000
- **2024**: New highs driven by ETF approval

### Adoption Milestones
- **2010**: First real-world transaction (pizzas for 10,000 BTC)
- **2014**: Microsoft accepts Bitcoin
- **2020**: Public companies add BTC to balance sheets
- **2021**: El Salvador adopts as legal tender
- **2024**: Bitcoin ETFs approved in US

### Institutional Adoption
- **ETFs**: Exchange-traded funds holding Bitcoin
- **Corporate Treasury**: Companies holding BTC as reserve asset
- **Banking Integration**: Traditional banks offering crypto services
- **Regulatory Framework**: Governments establishing clear rules

## ‚ö° Scaling Solutions

### Lightning Network
