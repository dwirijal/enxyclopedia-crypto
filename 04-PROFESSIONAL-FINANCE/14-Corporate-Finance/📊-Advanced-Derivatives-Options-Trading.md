## üìà Options Pricing & Greeks

### **Black-Scholes-Merton Framework**

#### **Model Matematika**
```
Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing Model:

European Call Option Price:
C = S‚ÇÄN(d‚ÇÅ) - Ke^(-rT)N(d‚ÇÇ)

European Put Option Price:
P = Ke^(-rT)N(-d‚ÇÇ) - S‚ÇÄN(-d‚ÇÅ)

Where:
d‚ÇÅ = [ln(S‚ÇÄ/K) + (r + œÉ¬≤/2)T] / (œÉ‚àöT)
d‚ÇÇ = d‚ÇÅ - œÉ‚àöT

Parameters:
S‚ÇÄ = Current stock price
K = Strike price
r = Risk-free interest rate
T = Time to expiration (years)
œÉ = Volatility of underlying asset
N(x) = Cumulative normal distribution function

Model Assumptions:
1. No dividends during option life
2. European exercise only
3. Markets are efficient (no arbitrage)
4. No transaction costs
5. Risk-free rate constant
6. Volatility constant
7. Log-normal distribution of returns

Model Limitations in Indonesian Context:
- Dividend payments common
- American-style options available
- Market inefficiencies exist
- Transaction costs significant
- Interest rate volatility
- Volatility clustering
- Fat-tailed returns
- Early exercise premiums
```

#### **Greeks - Sensitivity Analysis**
```
Options Greeks (Risk Measures):

1. Delta (Œî) - Price Sensitivity
Definition: Change in option price per $1 change in underlying
Calculation:
Call Delta: N(d‚ÇÅ)
Put Delta: N(d‚ÇÅ) - 1

Interpretation:
- Delta 0.50: Option moves $0.50 per $1 stock move
- Delta 0.25: Option moves $0.25 per $1 stock move
- Delta -0.30: Put option moves opposite to stock

Delta Hedging:
- Delta neutral portfolio
- Continuous adjustment needed
- Gamma risk consideration
- Transaction costs impact

Application to Indonesian Stocks:
BBCA Call Option (Strike 10,000, 30 days):
- Stock price: 9,800
- Option price: 350
- Delta: 0.45
- Hedge: Short 45 shares per 100 options

2. Gamma (Œì) - Delta Sensitivity
Definition: Change in delta per $1 change in underlying
Calculation: Œì = N'(d‚ÇÅ) / (S‚ÇÄœÉ‚àöT)

Interpretation:
- High gamma: Delta changes rapidly
- Low gamma: Delta changes slowly
- Gamma peaks near expiration
- ATM options have highest gamma

Gamma Trading:
- Long gamma benefits from volatility
- Short gamma hurts from volatility
- Gamma scalping strategies
- Risk management essential

3. Theta (Œò) - Time Decay
Definition: Change in option value per day passing
Calculation: Complex partial derivative

Interpretation:
- Negative for long options (time decay)
- Positive for short options (time benefit)
- Accelerates near expiration
- Higher for ATM options

Time Decay Strategies:
- Calendar spreads (long term, short term)
- Iron condor (income from time decay)
- Butterfly spreads (targeted time decay)
- Ratio spreads (decay differential)

4. Vega (ŒΩ) - Volatility Sensitivity
Definition: Change in option price per 1% change in volatility
Calculation: Complex partial derivative

Interpretation:
- Long options benefit from volatility increase
- Short options hurt from volatility increase
- Highest for ATM options
- Decreases with time

Volatility Trading:
- Long straddle/strangle (bet on volatility increase)
- Short straddle/strangle (bet on volatility decrease)
- Vega neutral strategies
- Volatility skew trading

5. Rho (œÅ) - Interest Rate Sensitivity
Definition: Change in option price per 1% change in interest rates
Calculation: Complex partial derivative

Interpretation:
- Calls benefit from rate increases
- Puts hurt from rate increases
- More significant for long-term options
- Minor impact for short-term options

Indonesian Market Application:
- Bank Indonesia rate changes
- Currency interest rate differentials
- Hedging currency exposure
- Yield curve strategies
```

## üéØ Advanced Options Strategies

### **Volatility Trading Strategies**

#### **Straddle & Strangle Strategies**
```
Volatility Trading Framework:

1. Long Straddle
Strategy Setup:
- Buy ATM call option
- Buy ATM put option
- Same strike price, same expiration
- Maximum risk: Premium paid
- Unlimited profit potential

Breakeven Points:
Upper Breakeven: Strike + Total Premium
Lower Breakeven: Strike - Total Premium

Example: BBCA Straddle (30 days to expiration)
- Current price: Rp 9,800
- Strike price: Rp 9,800
- Call premium: Rp 350
- Put premium: Rp 300
- Total cost: Rp 650

Breakeven Calculation:
Upper BE: Rp 9,800 + Rp 650 = Rp 10,450
Lower BE: Rp 9,800 - Rp 650 = Rp 9,150

Profit Scenarios:
Stock above Rp 10,450: Profit = Stock Price - Rp 10,450
Stock below Rp 9,150: Profit = Rp 9,150 - Stock Price
Stock between Rp 9,150-10,450: Maximum loss Rp 650

Market Conditions for Long Straddle:
- Expected volatility increase
- Earnings announcements
- Major economic data
- Political events
- Merger rumors

2. Short Straddle
Strategy Setup:
- Sell ATM call option
- Sell ATM put option
- Same strike price, same expiration

- Unlimited risk potential

Example: BBCA Short Straddle
- Strike price: Rp 9,800
- Call premium received: Rp 350
- Put premium received: Rp 300
- Total premium: Rp 650

Breakeven Points: Same as long straddle
Maximum Profit: Rp 650 (if stock at Rp 9,800 at expiration)

Risk Management:
- Stop loss orders essential
- Position sizing small
- Close before major events
- Monitor gamma risk

3. Long Strangle
Strategy Setup:
- Buy OTM call option
- Buy OTM put option
- Different strike prices, same expiration
- Lower cost than straddle
- Wider profit range

Example: BBCA Strangle
- Current price: Rp 9,800
- Call strike: Rp 10,500 (OTM)
- Put strike: Rp 9,000 (OTM)
- Call premium: Rp 150
- Put premium: Rp 120
- Total cost: Rp 270

Breakeven Points:
Upper BE: Rp 10,500 + Rp 270 = Rp 10,770
Lower BE: Rp 9,000 - Rp 270 = Rp 8,730

Advantages over Straddle:
- Lower cost (Rp 270 vs Rp 650)
- Wider breakeven range
- Lower delta exposure
- More time to be right

4. Short Strangle
Strategy Setup:

```

#### **Volatility Skew Trading**
```
Volatility Skew Analysis:

1. Understanding Volatility Skew
Definition:
- Different implied volatilities for different strikes
- OTM puts typically higher IV than OTM calls
- Reflects market fear and crash protection demand

Skew Types:
- Forward skew: Higher IV for higher strikes (commodities)
- Backward skew: Higher IV for lower strikes (equities)
- Smile: Higher IV for OTM options (currency)

Indonesian Market Skew Characteristics:
- Equity index: Moderate backward skew
- Single stocks: Varying by sector
- Currency: Mild smile pattern
- Commodities: Forward skew for some

2. Skew Trading Strategies
Risk Reversal:
- Buy OTM put, sell OTM call (or vice versa)
- Bet on skew changes
- Limited risk, unlimited potential
- Low or zero cost

Example: BBCA Risk Reversal
- Current price: Rp 9,800
- Buy 25 Delta Put: Strike Rp 9,200, Premium Rp 180
- Sell 25 Delta Call: Strike Rp 10,400, Premium Rp 120
- Net cost: Rp 60

Breakeven Analysis:
- If skew flattens: Profit
- If skew steepens: Loss
- Directional exposure: Minimal
- Maximum risk: Rp 60 + commissions

Butterfly Spread:
- Buy 1 OTM put, sell 2 ATM puts, buy 1 OTM call
- Bet on volatility contraction
- Limited risk, limited profit
- High probability trades

Example: BBCA Butterfly
- Buy 1 Put 9,000: Rp 120
- Sell 2 Puts 9,800: Rp 300 each (total Rp 600)
- Buy 1 Call 10,600: Rp 80
- Net cost: Rp 120 + Rp 80 - Rp 600 = -Rp 400 (credit)

Maximum Profit: Rp 400 (if stock at Rp 9,800 at expiration)
Maximum Risk: Rp 600 (difference between strikes minus credit)
Breakeven Points: Rp 9,200 and Rp 10,400

Calendar Spread:
- Buy far-term option, sell near-term option
- Bet on volatility term structure
- Time decay differential
- Directional neutral

Skew Trading in Indonesian Context:
Market Opportunities:
- Earnings season skew expansion
- Political event skew changes
- Sector-specific skew patterns
- Market crash skew spikes

Risk Considerations:
- Liquidity constraints in OTM options
- Wide bid-ask spreads

- p = Probability of winning
- q = Probability of losing (1-p)
- w = Average win size
- l = Average loss size

Options Application:
Example BBCA Straddle:
- p (probability of profit): 60%
- w (average win): Rp 400,000
- l (average loss): Rp 300,000
- q = 40%

Kelly Calculation:
f* = (0.6 √ó 400,000 - 0.4 √ó 300,000) / 400,000
f* = (240,000 - 120,000) / 400,000
f* = 120,000 / 400,000 = 0.30 or 30%

Practical Application:
- Full Kelly: 30% of capital
- Half Kelly: 15% of capital
- Quarter Kelly: 7.5% of capital
- Conservative: 5% of capital

2. Optimal F Strategy
Ralph Vince's Method:
- Calculate largest loss
- Determine optimal fraction
- Account for multiple positions
- Consider correlation effects

Example Calculation:
- Largest historical loss: Rp 500,000
- Account size: Rp 10,000,000
- Optimal f: 0.15 (15%)
- Position size: Rp 1,500,000

3. Volatility-Adjusted Sizing
Methodology:
- Higher volatility ‚Üí smaller positions
- Lower volatility ‚Üí larger positions
- Normalized risk exposure
- Consistent risk budgets

Formula:
Position Size = (Target Risk √ó Portfolio Value) / (Volatility √ó Option Delta)

Example:
- Target risk: 2% of Rp 10M = Rp 200,000
- Option volatility: 25%
- Option delta: 0.50
- Position size = (Rp 200,000) / (0.25 √ó 0.50) = Rp 1,600,000

4. Correlation-Based Position Sizing
Portfolio Correlation Considerations:
- High correlation: Smaller individual positions
- Low correlation: Larger individual positions
- Diversification benefits
- Risk concentration limits

Example Portfolio:
- BBCA options: Delta 0.45
- BBRI options: Delta 0.40
- Correlation: 0.85 (high)
- Individual position limit: 5% each
- Combined limit: 8% (not 10%)

5. Tail Risk Allocation
Black Swan Protection:
- Allocate 5-10% to tail risk hedging
- Far OTM options
- Long volatility positions
- Crash protection strategies

Example Tail Hedge:
- Portfolio value: Rp 100,000,000
- Tail risk allocation: 5% = Rp 5,000,000
- Buy OTM puts: Delta -0.10, 6 months
- Protection: Significant market crash
- Cost: Annual drag of 1-2%
