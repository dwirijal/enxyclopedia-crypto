## 📐 Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

### **Teori Dasar MPT**:
```
1. Core Concepts:
   Risk and Return Relationship:
   - Expected Return: R = Σ(Probability × Return)
   - Risk (Standard Deviation): σ = √[Σ(Pi × (Ri - E[R])²)]
   - Covariance: How assets move together
   - Correlation: Standardized covariance (-1 to +1)

   Portfolio Return:
   E[Rp] = w1×E[R1] + w2×E[R2] + ... + wn×E[Rn]
   Where: wi = weight of asset i, E[Ri] = expected return of asset i

   Portfolio Risk:
   σp² = ΣΣ(wi×wj×σij)
   Where: σij = covariance between assets i and j

2. Efficient Frontier:
   Concept: Optimal portfolios offering highest return for given risk
   Construction: Portfolio optimization using mean-variance analysis
   Selection: Investor chooses based on risk tolerance

   Mathematical Formulation:
   Minimize: σp² (portfolio variance)
   Subject to:
   - E[Rp] = Target return
   - Σwi = 1 (weights sum to 1)
   - wi ≥ 0 (no short selling constraints)

3. Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):
   Security Market Line:
   E[Ri] = Rf + βi × (E[Rm] - Rf)
   Where:
   - Rf = Risk-free rate
   - βi = Beta of asset i
   - E[Rm] = Expected market return
   - (E[Rm] - Rf) = Market risk premium

   Beta Calculation:
   βi = Cov(Ri, Rm) / Var(Rm)
   Interpretation:
   - β = 1: Same volatility as market
   - β > 1: More volatile than market
   - β < 1: Less volatile than market

4. Portfolio Performance Metrics:
   Sharpe Ratio:
   Sharpe = (Rp - Rf) / σp
   Measures excess return per unit of risk

   Treynor Ratio:
   Treynor = (Rp - Rf) / βp
   Measures excess return per unit of systematic risk

   Jensen's Alpha:
   α = Rp - [Rf + βp × (Rm - Rf)]
   Measures excess return relative to CAPM

   Information Ratio:
   IR = (Rp - Rb) / Tracking Error
   Measures excess return relative to benchmark per unit of active risk
```
