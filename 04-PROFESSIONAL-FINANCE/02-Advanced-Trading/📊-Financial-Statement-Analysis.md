   - Quick Ratio > 1x: Good short-term solvency
   - Cash Ratio > 0.2x: Adequate cash buffer

2. Rasio Solvabilitas (Solvency Ratios):
   - Debt to Equity = Total Debt / Total Equity
   - Debt to Assets = Total Debt / Total Assets
   - Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
   - Equity Ratio = Total Equity / Total Assets

   Interpretation:
   - D/E < 1x: Conservative leverage
   - D/E 1-2x: Moderate leverage
   - D/E > 2x: High leverage risk
   - Interest Coverage > 3x: Safe interest coverage

3. Rasio Profitabilitas (Profitability Ratios):

   - Inventory Turnover > 6x: Efficient inventory management
   - DSO < 45 days: Good collection efficiency
   - DIO < 60 days: Efficient inventory turnover

5. Rasio Pasar (Market Ratios):
   - Price to Earnings (P/E) = Market Price / EPS
   - Price to Book (P/B) = Market Price / Book Value per Share
   - Dividend Yield = Annual Dividend / Market Price
   - Earnings Yield = EPS / Market Price

   Interpretation:
   - P/E 10-20x: Reasonable valuation
   - P/B > 1x: Market values above book
