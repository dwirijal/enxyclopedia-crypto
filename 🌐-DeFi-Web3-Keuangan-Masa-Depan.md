# DeFi & Web3: The Future of Finance

## üåê What is DeFi?

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) refers to financial applications built on blockchain technology that operate without traditional financial intermediaries like banks, brokerages, or exchanges.

### Core Principles
- **Decentralization**: No single point of control
- **Transparency**: All transactions visible on blockchain
- **Permissionless**: Anyone can participate without approval
- **Composability**: Applications can work together seamlessly
- **Self-Custody**: Users control their own assets

### Traditional Finance vs DeFi
| **Aspect** | **Traditional Finance** | **DeFi** |
|------------|------------------------|----------|
| **Control** | Centralized institutions | Code and community governance |
| **Access** | Limited by geography, credit | Global, permissionless |
| **Hours** | Business hours only | 24/7/365 |
| **Settlement** | Days to weeks | Minutes to hours |
| **Fees** | High (intermediaries) | Low (automated) |
| **Transparency** | Limited | Fully transparent |
